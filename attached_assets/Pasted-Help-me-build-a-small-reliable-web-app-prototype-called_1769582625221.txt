Help me build a small, reliable web app prototype called “Forest Garden Plant” (a 3-tier productivity tracker).

Goal:
Create a working MVP that visualizes productivity with a simple 3-tier metaphor:
- Tier 1: Forest = life overview dashboard
- Tier 2: Garden = categories/projects
- Tier 3: Plant = individual tasks / focus sessions

IMPORTANT: Keep it simple and fully runnable.
Do NOT implement payments, real-world seed exchange, external integrations, or complex animations.
No PDF parsing, no scraping. Use only local data.

Core features (must-have):
1) Navigation with 3 main pages:
   - Forest (Overview)
   - Garden (Categories)
   - Plant (Tasks / Focus)

2) Data model (simple, in local storage):
   - Category (Garden): { id, name, color(optional) }
   - Task/Session (Plant): { id, categoryId, title, minutesFocused, status: "done" | "failed", dateISO }

3) Plant page (Atomic):
   - Form to add a task/session:
     - title
     - category selector
     - minutesFocused (number)
     - status (done/failed)
     - date (default today)
   - A list of sessions with filters:
     - by category
     - by status
   - On “save”, update local storage and show a toast/notification.

4) Garden page (Categorical):
   - Create/edit/delete categories
   - Show simple stats per category:
     - total minutes (last 7 days)
     - count of done vs failed sessions
   - Clicking a category navigates to Plant page filtered to that category.

5) Forest page (Macro overview):
   - “System status” blocks for a few life dimensions (use categories as dimensions):
     - If a category has no activity in the last 7 days, mark it as “barren”
     - Otherwise mark it as “healthy”
   - Monthly Focus Summary:
     - A simple bar chart for the last 6 months showing total minutes focused per month.
     - Use the stored sessions to compute totals.
     - If there is no data, display a friendly empty state with a button to add a session.

Design:
- Minimal, clean UI (student-friendly)
- Use simple iconography (optional)
- No fancy animations; only small transitions are fine.

MVP constraints:
- Use local storage only (no database required).
- Use mock seed data on first load (2 categories + a few sessions) so the charts aren’t empty.
- Ensure the app never crashes on first render: always use safe defaults (empty arrays).

Deliverable:
A working prototype where I can:
- Add sessions in Plant
- See category stats in Garden
- See barren/healthy status + 6-month bar chart in Forest

Start by building the MVP end-to-end first, then lightly polish UI.
